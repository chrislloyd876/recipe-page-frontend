- CSS Grid

### What I learned

1. I finally got to use tables in an actual project. I also learned about the use of line spacing on borders and table elements. It's a lot less complicated to organize than using other methods for that type of content. Just shows it's the right tool for the right job.

2. How to use CSS grid to center the body of the entire page rather than using Flexbox. 

3. I am also improving on how to use margin and padding to organize elements on the website.

```html
<table>
        <tr>
          <td>Calories</td>
          <td class="n-value">277kcal</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Carbs</td>
          <td class="n-value">0g</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Protein</td>
          <td class="n-value">20g</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Fat</td>
          <td class="n-value">22g</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
```
```css use of css grid
body{
    display: grid;
    place-items: center;
    min-height: 100vh;
    font-size: 16px;
    line-height: 1.5;
    background-color: hsla(14, 45%, 36%, 0.2);
}
```

### Continued development

I would really like to improve on developing my own style of design for a webpage. Creating better and more complex layouts that are interesting to navigate.

I also would like to improve on my consistency when working on projects.
